 # Lab 01 â€” Environment Setup & Git Workflow
 ## Tasks- [x] Install Node LTS, Git, VS Code- [x] Configure Git user and default branch- [x] Initialize repo and create semantic `index.html`- [x] Create `.gitignore` and `README.md`- [x] Open a Pull Request from a feature branch
 ## How to run
 Open `index.html` in a browser (or use VS Code Live Server).
## Reflection (100-150 words)
An HTTP request/response is the fundamental communication mechanism between a client (like a web browser) and a server. When a client wants to access data or perform an action, it sends an HTTP request to the server. The server then processes this request and sends back an HTTP response, which includes a status code and the requested data or an error message.
The status code I encountered was 200 OK, which means the request was successful and the server returned the expected content.
One thing I learned about Git is how powerful version control can be for collaboration. Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, track changes, and revert to previous versions if needed. Features like branching and merging make it easier to experiment without affecting the main codebase, and tools like GitHub enhance teamwork by enabling pull requests and code reviews.
